## about

dinny is a slack bot meant to organize a dinner rotation between my friends and me.

- It keeps track of meals eaten, meals cooked, and the meals eaten to meals cooked ratio.
- It can post status updates within slack to show each member's ratio, which will also encourage those with the worst ratios to cook next.  
- It can send out a 'who's eating tomorrow' message the day before someone cooks so those eating will be able to signal their intentions by liking the message.
