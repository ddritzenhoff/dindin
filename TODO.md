**TODO**

- [x] Add logging in handler functions
- [ ] Write tests for db operations
- [ ] Dockerize
- [x] Assign next week cooks
- [ ] Get upcoming cooks
- [x] Implement error wrapping
- [ ] Find a way to combine model and db-model into one. Right now, a change to the member model, for example, requires a corresponding change in almost all of the repository methods.
